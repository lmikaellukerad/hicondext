 To open our project in Unity, simply select this folder when in the open project dialog of Unity. Make sure the scene SuperMarket is opened (Assets/Scenes/SuperMarket.unity).
 Run the scene by pressing ctrl+P. Walking around can be done using WASD, looking around using the mouse, jumping by pressing the spacebar.
 The arms are controlled by the LeapMotion (SDK has to be installed), the separate fingers, and thus the grabbing motion, by the ManusVR (SDK included on GitHub).
To run the tests we made, you can open the Editor Tests Runner view, found under the Window tab.

 We use the following tools as recommended by CleVR: StyleCop, CodeMaid, GhostDoc and VSSpellingChecker. We use all these tools to improve our final product quality and increase productivity.
StyleCop is used to make sure all of our code has the same style. GhostDoc can automatically generate documentation which makes documenting our code faster and easier. 
To prevent spelling errors we use VSSpellingChecker, and CodeMaid makes it easier to run StyleCop on our code.

 We also make use of Unity Cloud Build which is an easy to use continuous integration solution for Unity projects.
To see our builds and wether or not they succeeded please create a Unity id and send us the email adress that was used so we can add you to the project.
When added the Unity Cloud Build project can be viewed at https://build.cloud.unity3d.com/orgs/tentacola/projects/context/

The objects branch is used for creating and updating our test environment.
