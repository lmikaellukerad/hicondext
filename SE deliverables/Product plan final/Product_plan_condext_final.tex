\chapter*{Introduction}
This product plan is written in the context of a project that is scheduled for the last quarter of the second year for computer science students. Besides the Delft University of technology, this project is conducted with collaboration of CleVR, a company that specializes in software solutions with virtual reality. CLeVR is
currently building a product that therapists can use during the treatment of psychosis. Our goal for thisproject is to let a future user, which in this case is the client, be able to interact with the virtual reality
using several hardware tools. \\ \\
The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for the seven weeks that follow after writing this.
All the sub-parts of the final product are listed in the product backlog. The planning for each week has
been outlined in the product roadmap and the initial requirements are also documented. However,
additional requirements could arise during the development.

\section{Functional}
%%%%%%%%%MUST HAVES%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Must haves} \\
\textit{Essential features required for a successful product}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user must be able to see his whole virtual body within the virtual world
\item The user must be able to move his virtual body by moving his real body with the use of the Kinect
\item  The user must be able to move his fingers separately using the provided tracking hardware:
Manus VR and Leap Motion
\item The user must be able to pick up items using a grabbing gesture with his hands
\item The virtual body must behave in a physically possible way, avoiding unnatural bending, and not
distressing the user
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%SHOULD HAVES%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Should haves} \\
\textit{Features that greatly improve the quality of the product but aren't essential}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user’s virtual body should not clip through objects in the virtual world
\item Virtual items should not clip through objects in the virtual world
\item The user should be able to put grocery items in a shopping cart or basket
\end{itemize} 
%%%%%%%%%COULD HAVES%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Could haves} \\
\textit{Non-essential features that are only implemented if there is enough time}
\begin{itemize}
\item The body of the user could be represented by a realistic looking 3D model
\item The user could move around in the virtual world with a controller
\item The user could interact with objects in another way than picking up, like pushing
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%WONT HAVES%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Won't haves} \\
\textit{Interesting features for future development that are not going to be implemented}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user won’t be able to move around in the virtual world using a VR walking pad like the Virtuix Omni
\item The hands will not get tracked when outside the vision of the leap motion (in front of the player)
\end{itemize}
\newpage

\section{Non-Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item The project must be developed on Unity3D
\item Classes must be unit tested when not hardware related
\item The framerate must stay around or above 90 fps
\item The final product should be finished before June 23, 2016, 18:55
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Product Roadmap}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\large{ \textbf{Sprint \arabic*}},leftmargin=3\parindent]
\item 
\begin{itemize}

\item Basic visualization of hands implemented (just a skeleton, not a textured 3d model)
\item Hand tracking and finger tracking with Leap Motion implemented
\item Demo of Unity3D environment and hand tracking
\end{itemize}
\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item Basic visual model of body finished (just a skeleton, not a textured 3d model)
